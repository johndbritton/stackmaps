# [StackMaps](http://johndbritton.com/stackmaps) - Interactive Maps of Stack Exchange Communities

http://johndbritton.com/stackmaps

## What

Easily view users from your favorite Stack Exchange community on a map.

## Why

I wanted to make it easy to browse the [Travel.SE](http://travel.stackexchange.com) users by location, so I built this little hack as part of my [48HourApps](http://48hourapps.com) series. It works for all Stack Exchange sites.

## Who
Created by [John Britton](http://johndbritton.com)

Logo built to order by [Chris Kennedy](http://kennedysgarage.com). Marker "[spiderfying](https://github.com/jawj/OverlappingMarkerSpiderfier)" by [George MacKerron](http://mackerron.com/home/). Searchable dropdown using [Chosen](http://harvesthq.github.com/chosen) by [Harvest][http://www.getharvest.com]. Google Maps, jQuery, and GitHub were used too.
